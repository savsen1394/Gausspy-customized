# Gausspy-customized
This is a reprository created by me to store all the Gausspy important files needed in order to perform one Gausspy fitting. This includes:
i) Tutorial_decompose_single_spectrum.ipynb
  This would include a python code with tutorial where we can use Gausspy+ to fit multiple spectral peaks present in our data. In this program only one       spectra of your choice (you need to select a particular pixel or offset value say (42,42)) will be decomposed and fit. I have also uploaded                 tutorial_decompose_single_spectrum.py which is exctly the same but with additional commands to plot the spectra code.

ii) Tutorial_example-GRS.ipynb
  This would include all the training routines and codes needed to produce the required spectra and all the python codes (.py files) are also present in     the reprository.

iii) Tutorial_helper_functions.ipynb
      This helps in understanding the helper functions.
